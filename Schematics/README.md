# Schematics

This folder contains an *EasyEDA* project with schematics used in all the Lab exercise lists. They **aren't fully configured** to work as systems, as the program was used to create abstract schematics. They're provided so anyone can have access and modify them. The `.png` files are simply images of these schematics to be able to show them in appropriate places in the exercise lists.
