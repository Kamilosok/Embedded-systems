# Schematics

This folder contains `.tex` files schematics created using **circuitikz** used in all the Lab exercise lists. The `.svg` files are simply compiled images of these schematics to be able to show them in appropriate places in the exercise lists.

## Compilation

To compile a specifix `.tex` schematic to a display-ready `.svg` simply set the **TARGET** to the file you want to compile and use `make`, `make clean` to cleanup compile residue, although it's already ignored in [.gitignore](.gitignore).
